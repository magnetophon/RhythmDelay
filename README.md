RhythmDelay
===========

tap a rhythm into your delay!

Each tap has the following insert-effects:
* a low-pass filter
* a reverb

There are two sets of controls for the insert FX: A and B.

The actual settings for each tap are a linear interpolation between the two.

Each delay-tap has a slider controlling the interpolation.
