RhythmDelay
===========

tap a rhythm into your delay!

there are some of insert-effects on each tap:
* a low-pass filter
* a reverb

there are two sets of controls for the insert FX: A and B
the actual settings for each tap are a linear interpolation between the two.
each delay-tap has a slider controlling the interpolation
